Boeing E-7A Wedgetail for Flightgear

The Boeing E-7 Wedgetail is a twin-engine airborne early warning and control aircraft based on the Boeing 737 Next Generation design. 
It has a fixed, active electronically scanned array radar antenna instead of a rotating one as with the 707-based Boeing E-3 Sentry. 
The E-7 was designed for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) under "Project Wedgetail" and designated E-7A Wedgetail.
The 737 AEW&C has also been selected by the Turkish Air Force under "Project Peace Eagle" and designated E-7T, the Republic of Korea Air Force under "Project Peace Eye", and the United Kingdom, designated Wedgetail AEW1. 
In April 2022, the United States Air Force announced that the E-7 will be replacing the E-3 beginning in 2027.
